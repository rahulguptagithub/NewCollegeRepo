						do not cover the Training Costs. They are heavily subsidized by
						the institute.

					<p style="margin-left: 35px;">Trainees who in the first five
						months of training lack a minimum of 90% attendance and/or do not
						show sufficient practical aptitude may be asked to leave. Special
						attention is given to ensure a high standard of morality and
						discipline in the Institute. Parents and guardians are requested
						to collaborate in this with the Institute authorities by insisting
						on their regular attendance, punctuality and diligence in their
						work. They will also co-operate further by enquiring about the
						progress of their wards and be present for meetings held for the
						same.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 35px;">Irregular attendance, prolonged
						absence (ten working days) without leave, ill health, stealing,
						disobedience, arrogance, disrespect towards members of the staff,
						bad conduct in or outside the Institute, bad moral influence or
						habitual unsatisfactory work will justify dismissal at any time by
						the authorities. In such matters the Principal’s decision is
						final.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 35px;">Trainees are expected to take
						part in all activities of the Institute.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 35px;">The official language in the
						Institute premises is English so as to foster a spirit of
						brotherhood and enable trainees to mix freely with each other
						irrespective of language or customs.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 35px;">Each one is responsible for the
						tools and instruments issued to him/her for use in the
						workshop/Lab. Any loss or damage to tools or machines or property
						must be made good by the one concerned.</p>

						Institute the Trainee must bring the reason for absence written in
						the Institute’s calendar duly signed by the parent/guardian. No

						permission of the Principal. Trainees who do not have at least 85%
						annual attendance, may be barred from appearing in the final
